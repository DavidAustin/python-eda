The following is up for discussion:

1) use a footprint family generator such as:
   mk_QFN-N.py, mk_WFDFN-N.py, mk_SOIC-N.py, mk_TSSOP-N.py,
   mk_CONN*.py, mk_RADIAL.py, mk_pe*.py, mk_holes.py
2) Naming standard for family generators - perhaps postfix with "-N"
3) w/x vs l/h/y definition/clarification - perhaps vertical/horizontal
   or stick with x/y standard coordinated frame: x = left/right, y = up/down
4) Merge mk_peSOT23_GSD.py and mk_SOT23_3.py
5) .sym generator (replacing .tsv) - particular for families
6) .sym to match manufacturer part number - likely the high level .sym
   generator should produce all names in the family
7) Check hole sizes - seems tight
8) Produce ruler for checking footprints
9) Add comment to link datasheet (to clarify dimensions)
10) More standardization:
    * uppercase vs lowercase
    * - vs _
    * should / characters be replaced with -
11) Should connectors show the minimal outline and maximum outline
   (e.g. plug) - or perhaps two different footprints depending on size
   objectives
12) Enforce 80 char line limit?
13) Increase pin clearance suitable for pcbway design rules
