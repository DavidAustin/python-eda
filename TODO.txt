The following is up for discussion:

1) use a footprint family generator such as:
   mk_QFN-N.py, mk_WFDFN-N.py, mk_SOIC-N.py, mk_TSSOP-N.py,
   mk_CONN*.py, mk_RADIAL.py, mk_pe*.py
2) w/x vs h/y definition/clarification - perhaps vertical/horizontal
3) .sym generator (replacing .tsv) - particular for families
4) .sym to match manufacturer part number - likely the high level .sym
   generator should produce all names in the family
