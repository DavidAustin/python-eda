The following is up for discussion:

* use a footpring family generator such as:
  mk_QFN-N.py, mk_WFDFN-N.py, mk_SOIC-N.py, mk_TSSOP-N.py
* w/x vs h/y definition/clarification - perhaps vertical/horizontal
* .sym generator (replacing .tsv) - particular for families
* .sym to match manufacturer part number - likely the high level .sym
  generator should produce all names in the family
